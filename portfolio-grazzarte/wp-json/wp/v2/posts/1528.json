Getting started can feel overwhelming, especially when you\u2019re unsure where to begin or struggling with creative block. One of the best ways to get inspired is by exploring portfolios from other designers. After decades working as a product designer, I\u2019ve compiled a list of my favourite design portfolio inspiration sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can often filter general web design inspiration sites by \u201cportfolio\u201d type, there aren\u2019t many dedicated to showcasing portfolio websites only. In this article, I\u2019ve evaluated the top design portfolio inspiration sites based on their update frequency, search and filter functionality, variety of examples, newsletters, and social media presence.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To simplify things, I\u2019ve also highlighted my 3 favourites. These design portfolio inspiration sites are sure to spark your creativity and help you craft a portfolio that truly stands out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a design portfolio website?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A design portfolio website is an online platform where designers showcase their work, skills, and expertise. It acts as a digital r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and gallery, allowing potential clients or employers to view a designer\u2019s design projects and understand their skills, style, and experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your portfolio website gives you a chance to freely express yourself&nbsp; without meddling clients or hovering art directors getting in the way. That\u2019s why portfolio websites are often the most unique and interesting websites out there on the internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my own portfolio site<\/a> that I created back in 2008. My goal was to create something unique to help me stand out from the crowd. It turned out that lots of designers liked the concept and were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/blog\/web-design\/imitation-truly-is-the-sincerest-form-of-flattery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u201cheavily inspired\u201d<\/a> by it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded border\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1402\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/site-grazzarte-portfolio-website.jpg\" alt=\"Design portfolio of site grazzarte\" class=\"wp-image-608\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/site-grazzarte-portfolio-website.jpg 1360w, https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/site-grazzarte-portfolio-website-291x300.jpg 291w, https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/site-grazzarte-portfolio-website-768x792.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A design portfolio website typically includes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Examples of past projects or case studies.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>An &#8220;about&#8221; section detailing the designer&#8217;s background and approach.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Contact information to allow others to get in touch via email or follow the designer on social media.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Additional features like testimonials, blog posts, or downloadable r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-crafted design portfolio website not only highlights technical and creative skills but also reflects the designer&#8217;s personal brand, making it a critical tool for career growth in the UX, product, and web design industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Quick portfolio website design tips<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow these tips to create a portfolio website that effectively showcases your work and skills, tells your story, and lands you the clients or design jobs you\u2019re after.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Define your purpose:<\/strong> Decide whether your portfolio will focus on attracting clients, showcasing skills for jobs, or sharing personal projects, and design accordingly.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Focus on your best work:<\/strong> Feature only your strongest projects to leave a lasting impression. Quality generally beats quantity in a portfolio website.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Show your personality:<\/strong> Infuse your site with unique design elements, colour schemes, or typography that reflect your personal brand and creativity. This is actually what helped <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my portfolio website<\/a> get featured in blog posts and galleries, as it was so different to others out there at the time.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Include an \u201cAbout\u201d page:<\/strong> People connect with people. Share your background, skills, and design philosophy to add a personal touch and connect with your audience.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Provide detailed case studies:<\/strong> Go beyond images by explaining your design process, challenges, and solutions to demonstrate your expertise. Be sure to highlight how your solution achieved the goal using metrics or customer feedback.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Build trust with social proof: <\/strong>Add testimonials, reviews, trust badges, or client logos to reassure visitors of your credibility and reliability.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Highlight your role:<\/strong> Clearly specify your contributions in collaborative projects to give visitors a clear understanding of your skills and involvement.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use high-quality visuals:<\/strong> Ensure your work is presented with large, high-resolution images or mockups to showcase your designs in the best light. Demonstration videos can also work well to show animations and interactions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Add a clear call-to-action:<\/strong> Make it easy for potential clients or employers to contact you by including a prominent call to action. Contact forms work well and help ensure you collect the information you need to provide a quote for client projects.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keep it updated:<\/strong> Regularly add new projects, update your skills, and remove outdated work to ensure your portfolio remains relevant. This is the one that many of us, including myself, struggle with.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3 best design portfolio inspiration sites<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that sets portfolio websites apart from others is that you can run wild with your creativity. I love to see the many different ways creative people present themselves and their work. The following design portfolio inspiration sites are my favourite of the bunch. Each of them excels across most of the judging criteria, so I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll help inspire you while creating or updating your portfolio website design. I\u2019ve focussed on showcasing free sites to ensure they\u2019re accessible to all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Killer Portfolio<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded border\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/killer-portfolio-design-portfolio-inspiration-1.webp\" alt=\"killer portfolio design portfolio inspiration\" class=\"wp-image-1559\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/killer-portfolio-design-portfolio-inspiration-1.webp 1360w, https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/killer-portfolio-design-portfolio-inspiration-1-300x176.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/killer-portfolio-design-portfolio-inspiration-1-768x452.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/12\/killer-portfolio-design-portfolio-inspiration-1-680x400.webp 680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table class=\"summary-list\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Updated:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Ad-hoc<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Community submissions:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Curation:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Mike Harmer<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Filters:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Type<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Website preview:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Multiple large desktop screenshots<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Newsletter:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Monthly<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Social media channels:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">X<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Price:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Free<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Killer Portfolio is my favourite free design portfolio inspiration site because it&#8217;s different from the others. Every portfolio featured on the site comes with commentary and numerous screenshots to help you understand what makes each portfolio design special. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s basically a small case study for each portfolio to unlock the secrets of what makes a killer portfolio. Curated by Mike Harmer, you can really tell that they have a passion for portfolio website design and know how to find particularly beautiful and unique portfolios.&nbsp;The extra effort Mike puts into each of the featured portfolio sites sets this resource ahead of the rest.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The site highlights diverse portfolio styles, providing a wealth of inspiration for designers looking to create their own standout online presence. Its clean layout and well-organised structure make browsing seamless and enjoyable. I find myself just sitting at my desk with my cup of tea browsing through each portfolio one at a time. It&#8217;s fun to see the weird and wonderful things designers create when they have full creative freedom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unique features include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Case studies for each portfolio: <\/strong>Rather than simply displaying a screenshot of the portfolio website, each portfolio comes with commentary and numerous screenshots to help you understand what makes it a killer portfolio.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Beautifully curated selection:<\/strong> The curator, Mike Harmer, has particularly good taste and selects only the most impressive portfolio designs to showcase.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Clean, distraction-free interface:<\/strong> The site itself is designed beautifully with some clever visual details, making it a pleasure to browse.

I\u2019d love to see more search filters added in the future though, as they\u2019re currently limited to a handful based on the portfolio website style. Each portfolio site comes with a large desktop screenshot along with details regarding the platform used to build the site and the fonts used.

The profile includes a little bit about them, where they\u2019re located, how many years work experience they have, as well as the companies they\u2019ve worked for.

Luckily, there\u2019s still much on offer, as a well designed website can last the test of time, especially if its design fundamentals are solid.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design of this portfolio inspiration site is super minimal.
