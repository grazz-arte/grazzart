There\u2019s something magical about being constrained to a tiny canvas of 24 by 24 pixels. Obviously, many other designers feel the same, as they\u2019re spending hundreds of hours crafting beautiful free icon sets for us to use in our website and app projects.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re really lucky to have so many icon sets to choose from, but it can be tricky and time consuming to find a high quality icon set that meets your needs.&nbsp;I\u2019ve searched through hundreds of icon sets over the years and picked out the best free icon sets for UI design. They&#8217;re all completely free to use in both personal and commercial projects, which is pretty amazing if you ask me. This means that you can use them in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.practical-ui.com\/design-system\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">design system<\/a> too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also summarised the features of each icon set to make them faster and easier to compare. At a glance you can see the number of icons, icon styles, file formats, development libraries, and customisation options.&nbsp;Let&#8217;s learn a little bit about icons before comparing my top free icon sets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is an icon set?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An icon is a small, simple visual representation of an idea, action, or object. In UI design, icons are used to help users quickly find and recognise elements. For example, a trash can icon generally represents &#8220;delete,&#8221; and a magnifying glass icon represents &#8220;search.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded border\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/what-is-an-icon-set.webp\" alt=\"free icon sets\" class=\"wp-image-1365\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/what-is-an-icon-set.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/what-is-an-icon-set-300x176.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/what-is-an-icon-set-768x452.webp 768w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/what-is-an-icon-set-680x400.webp 680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>An icon set is a collection of icons designed in a consistent style. Icon sets help maintain design consistency across digital products by providing a unified visual language. They are often used in <a href=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/blog\/design-systems\/design-system-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">design systems<\/a> across web and app design to simplify navigation and make interfaces more intuitive and user-friendly. Designers can select icons from the set to match their needs, ensuring the visual style and meaning remain cohesive throughout the project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What makes a high quality free icon set?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick breakdown of what to look for when choosing an icon set for your project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Clarity and simplicity<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Effective icons communicate their meaning instantly and clearly. Simplicity is key, each icon should represent its function or concept without unnecessary detail. Each icon in the set should use universally recognized symbols or follow familiar visual conventions. This helps ensure that users can quickly understand the icons&#8217; meanings even without a text label. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some icon sets will reduce visual complexity as the size of the icon decreases. This means they\u2019ll have separate sets of icon designs for different sized icons.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"616\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/free-icon-set-small-icon-1.webp\" alt=\"24pt icon has less detail than a 16pt icon\" class=\"wp-image-1373\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/free-icon-set-small-icon-1.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/free-icon-set-small-icon-1-300x136.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/free-icon-set-small-icon-1-768x348.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sufficient number of icons<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most icons sets contain a few hundred of the most common universal icons, so they should meet your needs for most projects. There\u2019s generally no need for huge icon sets with thousands of icons, as recognition of most of the icons would be low anyway. If you\u2019re creating a specific type of app, like a music or travel app, look for icon sets that contain those types of icons. Top icon sets often organise icons into categories to make it easy to check what\u2019s on offer. You can always modify existing icons to meet your needs too, or even create your own to add to the set.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Icons should look consistent<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong icon set maintains a consistent style throughout, including uniform line thickness, shapes, curves, and proportions. Consistency ensures that the icons look cohesive together, creating a polished and professional design. Whether the style is flat, outlined, or filled, it should remain the same across all icons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Icons should come in a range of file formats<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for icon sets that come in a range of file formats. SVG and Figma formats are best. PNG files are less flexible, as they\u2019re not vector images and can\u2019t be resized without pixelation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded border\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1014\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/icon-file-formats.webp\" alt=\"different icon file formats in a free icon set\" class=\"wp-image-1370\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/icon-file-formats.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/icon-file-formats-300x224.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/icon-file-formats-768x573.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some icon sets also support development libraries like React, Vue, and other JavaScript frameworks. These libraries allow you to quickly import and use icons in your code, making them easy to manage and customise within your app. Free icon sets don&#8217;t often support many development libraries, but luckily I&#8217;ve found some amazing ones that do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other icon sets are also available as icon fonts. Icon fonts turn icons into font characters, allowing you to use them in websites similarly to text. This makes them easy to customise with CSS and simple to integrate in your website code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Icons should be easy to find<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many icons it can be hard to find the one you&#8217;re after. Some free icon sets have a website with search functionality which makes it a lot faster to find what you need. Some also provide a <a href=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/blog\/web-design\/10-best-figma-plugins-for-web-design-in-2024\">Figma plugin<\/a> where you can quickly search for the icon you\u2019re after and insert it into Figma in seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded border\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"984\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/search-icons.webp\" alt=\"Free icon set search functionality\" class=\"wp-image-1372\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/search-icons.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/search-icons-300x217.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/search-icons-768x556.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Icons should be easily customisable<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Icon sets that allow customization, such as changing colours, stroke width, or fills, offer more flexibility. Designers often need to tailor icons to match their brand or style, so having an adaptable set can be a major advantage. Most free icon sets come in both a line and a fill style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Additional extras to look out for<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few extra things that make an icon set faster and easier to use. Being able to copy an icon from the icon set\u2019s website to your clipboard makes it faster to paste it into your design in Figma. Being able to filter by categories is also handy. A <a href=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/blog\/web-design\/10-best-figma-plugins-for-web-design-in-2024\">Figma plugin<\/a> where you can search for the icon you\u2019re after and insert it into your design is even better.&nbsp;These are big asks for free icon sets, but many of the icon sets in this list have these features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>UX design guidelines for using icons<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we start comparing free icon sets, let&#8217;s go through some quick UX design guidelines to help ensure that we&#8217;re using icons correctly. If you&#8217;re looking to learn more about UI design, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/blog\/ui-design\/ui-design-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">16 little  UI design tips that make a big impact<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Use common symbols to help ensure recognition<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Icons should be instantly recognisable and convey a clear meaning. Avoid using overly abstract or complex icons that might confuse users. It\u2019s safest to use common icons that most people are familiar with. These are sometimes called \u201cuniversal icons\u201d, as they\u2019re universally understood by most people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"520\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/universal-icons.webp\" alt=\"Examples of universal icons\" class=\"wp-image-1374\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/universal-icons.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/universal-icons-300x115.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/universal-icons-768x294.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If an icon&#8217;s meaning isn&#8217;t obvious, don\u2019t use it, or consider pairing it with a text label to improve clarity. If you\u2019re unsure, conduct usability testing with your target audience. Even commonly used icons can have different interpretations across cultures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Maintain consistency across icons<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Use a consistent style for icons throughout the interface. This includes matching line thickness, colour, border radius, and size. A uniform icon style helps create a cohesive visual language and improves user familiarity. If you choose a high quality icon set, you won\u2019t need to worry about maintaining consistency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Try to pair icons with text<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how common a particular icon is, there\u2019s a risk that its meaning may not be immediately clear. Adding a text label can help ensure the meaning of an icon is clear. This is particularly important for complex actions or less common icons. If there are space constraints on the interface, it\u2019s ok to use an icon without text, as long as the icon\u2019s meaning is commonly understood by users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"520\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/pair-icons-with-text-1.webp\" alt=\"Heart icon without a label vs heart icon with a label of &quot;Favourites&quot;\" class=\"wp-image-1378\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/pair-icons-with-text-1.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/pair-icons-with-text-1-300x115.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/pair-icons-with-text-1-768x294.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Use icons purposefully<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I say in my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.practical-ui.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Practical UI design book<\/a>, every detail on an interface should earn its place by having a logical purpose behind it. Icons are no different. Not every action on an interface needs an icon. Too many icons can overwhelm users or make it difficult to focus on key actions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ensure icons have sufficient contrast<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrast is a measure of the difference in perceived brightness between two colours. It\u2019s expressed as a ratio ranging from 1:1 to 21:1. For example, black text on a black background has the lowest 1:1 contrast ratio, whereas black text on a white background has the highest 21:1 ratio. There are many online tools to help you measure contrast ratios between different colours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to help ensure that people with low vision can clearly see interface details, like icons, aim to at least meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 level AA colour contrast requirements. User interface elements that convey information, like icons, require a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"520\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/icon-contrast-ratio.webp\" alt=\"Low contrast icon vs high contrast icon\" class=\"wp-image-1384\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/icon-contrast-ratio.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/icon-contrast-ratio-300x115.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/icon-contrast-ratio-768x294.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Avoid visually complex icons<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since icons are generally very small in size, typically 24px by 24px, it\u2019s important to keep them simple and minimal to improve legibility. For very small icons, like 16px by 16px, reduce their visual complexity even further. Well designed icons sets will automatically reduce visual complexity as the size of the icon decreases. Only one of the free icon sets in this article offers this level of detail, Heroicons by the Tailwind CSS team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"616\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/free-icon-set-small-icon-1.webp\" alt=\"24pt icon has less detail than a 16pt icon\" class=\"wp-image-1373\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/free-icon-set-small-icon-1.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/free-icon-set-small-icon-1-300x136.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/free-icon-set-small-icon-1-768x348.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ensure icon touch targets are sufficient<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Small targets are more difficult to click or touch than large ones. This is especially true for those with impaired motor control, or even someone holding their phone with one hand and using their thumb.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re using icons as interactive buttons, try to stick to the following guidelines to ensure they have a sufficient target size:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Make buttons at least 48pt by 48pt in size. This aligns with an 8pt grid and is slightly larger than the WCAG recommendation of 44pt by 44pt.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make frequently used buttons even larger to improve efficiency and to help avoid them being missed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Separate buttons by at least 8pt to help prevent people mistakenly pressing the wrong one.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ensure icons match your brand<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Icons come in a range of styles to suit different aesthetics. Some have rounded corners for a relaxed and friendly vibe, while others are sharper for a more serious feel. Depending on your brand vibe, make sure you choose an icon set that suits your brand.&nbsp;The free icon sets in this article come in a range of different aesthetic styles, from soft and round to sharp and angular.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some icon sets allow you to alter the corner radius and border thickness, making them especially suitable for a range of different brands. Other icon sets have a neutral look and feel which should also work well for most brands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3 best free icon sets<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many icon sets to choose from, it\u2019s hard to find the best icon set for your web or app project. I\u2019ve searched through hundreds of icon sets over the years and picked out the best free icon sets for UI design. The top 3 icon sets are all beautifully crafted, have a large number of icons, many file formats, support popular front end development libraries, and offer flexible customisation options.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Phosphor icon set<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"714\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/phosphor-icon-set-1.webp\" alt=\"Phosphor free icon set\" class=\"wp-image-1354\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/phosphor-icon-set-1.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/phosphor-icon-set-1-300x158.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/phosphor-icon-set-1-768x403.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table class=\"summary-list\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Number of icons:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">1,248<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Styles:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Line, fill, duotone<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">File formats:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">SVG, Figma<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Code libraries:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Web, React, Vue, Flutter, Elm, Swift<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Figma plugin:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Search functionality:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Customisation options:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Size, stroke width, colour<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Phosphor is my favourite free icon set for many reasons. As soon as you land on the website, you can clearly see the high quality and attention to detail. The creators, Helena Zhang and Tobias Fried, did an amazing job crafting each and every icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because they designed the icons at 16px by 16px, rather than the conventional 24px by 24px, the icons are highly legible at small sizes. With over a thousand icons to choose from, you\u2019re sure to have everything you need for most website and app projects. There are lots of handy customisation options too, including size, stroke width, and colour, which makes this free icon set especially flexible for different brand aesthetics.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1082\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/phosphor-icon-set-2.webp\" alt=\"Phosphor icon set search filter\" class=\"wp-image-1339\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/phosphor-icon-set-2.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/phosphor-icon-set-2-300x239.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/phosphor-icon-set-2-768x611.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the usual SVG format, there\u2019s also a Figma file that you can add to your design system.

Created and maintained by Pawel Kuna along with a bunch of keen contributors, this huge open source icon set of over 5,000 icons is beautifully crafted and full of handy features.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Icons are designed on a 24px by 24px grid with a 2px stroke weight. The icon style is neutral and modern with curved corners and sharp ends. They come in both a line and fill style and can be customised by size, stroke width, and colour. This makes them super flexible for just about any website or app project you\u2019re working on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded border\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"942\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/tabler-icon-set-customise.webp\" alt=\"Tabler icon set customiser\" class=\"wp-image-1361\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/tabler-icon-set-customise.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/tabler-icon-set-customise-300x208.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/tabler-icon-set-customise-768x532.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers will also love this icon set, as there are libraries for most front end frameworks. This makes it really quick and easy to install the icon library and use them in your code immediately. There\u2019s also a Figma plugin to help speed up designer\u2019s workflows.

One of the main reasons behind the quality of this beautiful minimal icon set is the fact that it was based on the father of all free icon sets, Feather icons, created by Cole Bemis.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the Feather icon set is no longer actively maintained, the Lucide team, along with their community of contributors, is actively building on and improving this beautiful minimalist icon set. They\u2019ve cleverly created icon design guidelines based on the original Feather icons style, to help ensure quality and consistency across the community of contributors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"908\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/lucide-icon-set-guidelines.webp\" alt=\"Lucide icon set guidelines\" class=\"wp-image-1359\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/lucide-icon-set-guidelines.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/lucide-icon-set-guidelines-300x200.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/lucide-icon-set-guidelines-768x513.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While this open source icon set only comes in a line icon style, you can still create filled versions of most icons if needed. There\u2019s also a handy style customiser that allows you to adjust colour, stroke width, and size. There\u2019s even an option to fix the stroke width regardless of the icon size. The search and category filter are also super handy to help find the icons you\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"658\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/lucide-icon-set-customiser.webp\" alt=\"Lucide icon set customiser\" class=\"wp-image-1358\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/lucide-icon-set-customiser.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/lucide-icon-set-customiser-300x145.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/lucide-icon-set-customiser-768x372.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Heaps of development library packages are available to make it quick and easy to integrate Lucide icons into your development project. They include Web, React, React Native, Vue, Vue 3, Svelte, Preact, Solid, Angular, NodeJS, and Flutter. I love that the Lucide community is driven to expand the Feather icon set while remaining true to the original minimalist design language.

Their beautiful minimal aesthetic has made them one of the most popular icon sets of all time, so there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve already seen them in multiple websites and apps. While it\u2019s not a particularly large icon set, it has been the inspiration for many other icons sets. The creator, Cole Bemis, should be really proud of his creation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Feather icons only come in a line style, you can customise their size, stroke width, and colour. There\u2019s also a Figma file and Figma plugin available. The project itself doesn\u2019t support many development libraries, but there are many related spin off projects that have you covered. If you\u2019re looking for a beautiful minimal line icon set, then Feather could be for you. I liked them so much that I used them in my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.practical-ui.com\/design-system\/\">Practical UI&nbsp;Figma design system<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/feathericons.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">View Feather icon set<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Heroicons icon set<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/heroicons-icon-set.webp\" alt=\"Heroicons free icon set\" class=\"wp-image-1397\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/heroicons-icon-set.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/heroicons-icon-set-300x176.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/heroicons-icon-set-768x452.webp 768w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/heroicons-icon-set-680x400.webp 680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table class=\"summary-list\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Number of icons:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">316<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Styles:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Line, fill, mini, micro<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">File formats:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">SVG, Figma<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Code libraries:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">React, Vue<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Figma plugin:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">No<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Search functionality:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Customisation options:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">No<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Heroicons were created by the super talented Steve Schoger and the Tailwind CSS team. As with all of Steve\u2019s products, this icon set is really high quality. Rather than simply allowing you to scale the icons to any size, like most icons sets, Heroicons have been created at specific sizes to ensure maximum clarity and legibility. If we look at the following example, you can see that the level of visual detail in the icon decreases as it gets smaller. This level of detail is rarely seen in paid icon sets, let alone free icon sets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"616\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/heroicons-size-detail.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1398\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/heroicons-size-detail.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/heroicons-size-detail-300x136.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/heroicons-size-detail-768x348.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not a very large icon set, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in quality.
