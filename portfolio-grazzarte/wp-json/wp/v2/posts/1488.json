One of the best ways to overcome this hurdle is by exploring other websites for inspiration. After decades of designing landing pages, I\u2019ve compiled a list of my favourite landing page design inspiration sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many options available, it can be tricky to know where to start. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve compared the top landing page design inspiration sites based on their update frequency, search and filter functionality, website previews, newsletters, and social media presence. To make it even easier, I\u2019ve highlighted my top three picks for landing page inspiration.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these landing page design inspiration sites are completely free to use too, which makes them accessible to everyone. Hopefully, these resources will spark your creativity and make your landing page design process faster and smoother.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a landing page?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A landing page is a standalone web page designed to guide visitors toward a specific goal or action. Unlike a full website, which typically includes multiple pages and navigation options, a landing page focuses on delivering a clear and targeted message. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s often used in marketing campaigns to drive conversions, such as signing up for a newsletter, downloading a resource, or purchasing a product. Here\u2019s an example of a landing page I created for my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.practical-ui.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">UI design book<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1200\" height=\"917\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/practical-ui-book-landing-page.jpg\" alt=\"practical ui book landing page\" class=\"wp-image-1514\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/practical-ui-book-landing-page.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/practical-ui-book-landing-page-300x229.jpg 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/practical-ui-book-landing-page-768x587.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Key features of a landing page:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Single goal:<\/strong> The entire page is designed around one call-to-action (CTA) that you\u2019re encouraging the user to take.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Minimal navigation:<\/strong> It reduces distractions by limiting or removing external links and navigation menus.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Focused content:<\/strong> The messaging is clear, concise, and aligned with the audience&#8217;s intent.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Optimised design:<\/strong> Visual elements and layouts are crafted to highlight the call to action and guide user attention.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Quick landing page design tips<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some practical landing page design tips to help you design effective and high-converting landing pages that deliver results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Define a clear goal:<\/strong> Focus on a single, specific objective, such as lead generation, sales, or sign-ups.

I was lucky enough to have my <a href=\"https:\/\/onepagelove.com\/practical-ui\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">UI design book\u2019s landing page<\/a> featured on the site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main things that makes One Page Love such a powerful tool for finding landing page design inspiration is the comprehensive tagging system. Each and every website is meticulously tagged based on its features, industry, typefaces, and platform. The large thumbnails also make it super quick to browse layouts at a glance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with landing page design inspiration, the site also includes templates, tutorials, and helpful resources for crafting impactful single-page websites. You can easily stay in the loop via numerous social media channels and the bi-weekly newsletter is especially helpful. Definitely a handy resource for landing page design inspiration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unique features include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Focus on one-page websites<\/strong>: You\u2019ll only find single-page website designs on this site, which often make the most powerful landing pages due to their laser focus and simplicity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Huge collection: <\/strong>With over 8,000 curated single page websites, this is one of the largest collections I know of.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Extensive variety<\/strong>: The collection spans multiple industries and styles, from personal portfolios to corporate landing pages.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Additional resources<\/strong>: It offers templates, design tips, and tutorials, making it more than just an inspiration site.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Comprehensive tagging<\/strong>: The website\u2019s categorisation system helps you quickly filter and find landing pages that suit specific design needs or themes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>High-quality curation<\/strong>: Low quality sites simply won\u2019t make the cut.

The search filters are also super handy, as you can filter by a large range of categories, typefaces, and colours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lapa Ninja are also generous with their website screenshots, displaying multiple full page screenshots of the entire website.

It has a huge curated collection of some of the best landing page designs on the web. While it started off as a completely free resource, the team has recently introduced a paid version which unlocks some of the new \u201cpro\u201d features. This small fee helps them pay the bills and keep developing new features, which is very fair if you ask me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The free version is pretty good and includes a bunch of search filters as well as full page screenshots for both desktop and mobile. It\u2019s not just landing pages either, they\u2019ve also curated collections for other website types including portfolios, blogs, and ecommerce stores. In addition to that, there are collections for different page types too, such as about pages, pricing pages, and sign up pages.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paid version unlocks access to more categories, components, and search filters. It unlocks mobile screenshot previews and also allows you to save inspiration to folders for better organisation. Another cool thing is that you can see older versions of each website or page to see how they\u2019ve evolved over time. Definitely a handy resource when you\u2019re looking to design a landing page and need some inspiration. If you don\u2019t mind paying a small fee, the pro version is my pick of the bunch.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unique features include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Huge variety of landing pages:<\/strong> Showcases hundreds of landing page designs across different industries and styles, giving you plenty of ideas to explore.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Powerful filtering:<\/strong> Lets you filter pages by component, colour, style, industry, type, desktop, and mobile, ensuring you find designs that match your goals quickly.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Daily updates:<\/strong> Frequently adds new designs to keep the inspiration flowing and up-to-date with the latest trends.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Desktop and mobile screenshots:<\/strong> Displays full-page screenshots of designs in both desktop and mobile orientation, so you don\u2019t need to leave the site.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bookmarking feature:<\/strong> Allows you to save your favourite designs for easy access later.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/land-book.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Visit Landbook<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other great landing page design inspiration sites<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The top 3 landing page design inspiration sites might be sufficient for most, but if you\u2019re keen for more, I\u2019ve got you covered.

If the website has multiple pages, the other pages are captured too. So, you never need to leave the site. You can also subscribe to the weekly newsletter if you prefer to get your fix of landing page design inspiration in your inbox.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filters are pretty simple and only allow you to filter by website type and platform, but that\u2019s often all you need.
