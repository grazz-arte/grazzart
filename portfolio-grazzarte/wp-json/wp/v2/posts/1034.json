When designing an interface, there are so many options to choose from regarding layout, spacing, typography, and colour, it can quickly get overwhelming.&nbsp;That\u2019s why having a system of predefined options and guidelines to help you efficiently make design decisions is crucial. This is known as a design system and in this guide you&#8217;ll learn how to build a design system in 3 steps.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a design system?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.practical-ui.com\/design-system\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">design system<\/a> is like a box of LEGO bricks for digital products. Just as LEGO bricks come in different shapes, sizes, and colours that you can snap together to build anything you can imagine, a design system provides a set of pre-made components, like buttons, icons, and form inputs, that you can combine to create consistent and cohesive user interfaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like with LEGO, where you have instructions to guide you in building a specific model, a design system comes with guidelines that show you how to use the components. This ensures that the website or application you&#8217;re building looks and works consistently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A design system serves as a single source of truth that ensures that all design and development teams are aligned, enabling them to build unified products more efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of a design system<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re working on a small website or a complex web application, a design system is a must-have for many reasons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Consistency:<\/strong> Ensures a uniform look and feel across all products, enhancing the user experience.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Efficiency:<\/strong> Speeds up the design and development process by providing ready-to-use components and design guidelines.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Scalability:<\/strong> Makes it easier to scale products by providing a foundation that can grow with the brand or product.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Collaboration:<\/strong> Enhances collaboration between design and development teams by providing a common language and set of tools.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Quality Control:<\/strong> Helps maintain high-quality standards across all designs, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to create a design system<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we know what a design system is and what the benefits are, let&#8217;s build a design system in 3 steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Set predefined style options for colour, typography, and spacing.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create reusable modules known as a component library.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Define usage guidelines.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Set predefined style options<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than choosing from unlimited options for things like colour, typography, and spacing, create a small set of predefined options to choose from. Limiting your options in this way helps improve consistency and speeds up decision making. These predefined reusable options are often referred to as \u201ctokens\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design system colour options<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Create a small set of predefined colour options called a colour palette. The following colour palette is made up of variations of the brand colour. Each colour has a purpose to help you quickly decide how and where to use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, actions like buttons and text links are often assigned the brand colour from the colour palette. Using a consistent colour for interactive elements helps teach people what\u2019s interactive and what\u2019s not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, there\u2019s no need to spend countless hours searching for different shades of grey for form input borders, checkbox borders, and radio button borders. Simply assign a colour variation from the colour palette to use for all interface element borders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a simple yet powerful colour palette that works for most websites and apps. It\u2019s made up of 5 variations of the brand colour. Use the main brand colour hue as a base and change the saturation and brightness to create the other variations. You\u2019ll need to use the HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) colour system to do this.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"388\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-colour-palette.webp\" alt=\"Design system colour palette\" class=\"wp-image-1037\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-colour-palette.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-colour-palette-300x86.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-colour-palette-768x219.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Each colour has a purpose to help you quickly decide how and where to use it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Brand<\/strong> &#8211; used to indicate interactive elements like text links and buttons.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Text strong<\/strong> &#8211; used for primary text, like headings, body content, and form labels to ensure they\u2019re prominent and legible.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Text weak<\/strong> &#8211; used for supporting text to make it less prominent.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stroke strong<\/strong> &#8211; used for non-decorative borders on interface elements like form input fields.

Make sure that colours used for text (\u201cBrand\u201d, \u201cText strong\u201d, and \u201cText weak\u201d) have a 4.5:1 contrast ratio.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colours used for interface elements, like \u201cStroke strong\u201d, need at least a 3:1 contrast ratio. There are lots of tools to help you measure colour contrast, my favourites are the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.figma.com\/community\/plugin\/748533339900865323\/contrast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Contrast Figma plugin<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/webaim.org\/resources\/contrastchecker\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Web AIM online contrast check tool<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about using colour in UI design, check out my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.practical-ui.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">UI design book<\/a>.

Define the font sizes, line-heights and weights once and reuse them throughout an interface. This helps speed up decision making and improve consistency across your product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a type scale is a simple and logical way to create a set of balanced font sizes that work well together. To create your set of font sizes, start with a base font size for body text, then keep multiplying it by a certain scale to create larger font sizes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some popular type scales, ordered from smallest to largest:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>1.067 \u2013 Minor Second<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1.125 \u2013 Major Second<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1.200 \u2013 Minor Third<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1.250 \u2013 Major Third<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1.333 \u2013 Perfect Fourth<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1.414 \u2013 Augmented Fourth<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1.500 \u2013 Perfect Fifth<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1.618 \u2013 Golden Ratio<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, start with a base font size of 16px and use a \u201c1.200 &#8211; Minor Third\u201d scale. Multiply 16px by 1.2 to get the next font size of 19.2px. Round it to 20px for simplicity. Then take 20px and multiply it by 1.2 to get the next font size, and so on. The following is an example set of font sizes using a slightly modified Minor Third type scale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1128\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-typography-type-scale.webp\" alt=\"Design system typography type scale\" class=\"wp-image-1042\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-typography-type-scale.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-typography-type-scale-300x249.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-typography-type-scale-768x637.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With most type scales, you\u2019ll notice that the resulting font sizes have messy decimal values. Round font sizes to the nearest whole number for simplicity. It\u2019s not crucial that font sizes are divisible by 4, but try to ensure that their line height is. This will align your text neatly to a 4pt vertical layout grid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t need to stick strictly to a scale. Once you get more confident with font sizes, you can adjust them to better suit the interface you\u2019re designing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design system spacing options<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Deciding on the ideal spacing between interface elements can be a frustrating and time consuming process, as there are so many options to choose from. In my early days as a designer, I remember painstakingly pushing interface elements back and forth, a pixel at a time, until they looked perfect.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a limited set of predefined spacing options (as seen below) can speed up your design process significantly, making you a much more efficient designer. Using consistent spacing options will also result in a neater, simpler interface design that\u2019s faster to build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"560\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-spacing-tokens.webp\" alt=\"Design system spacing tokens\" class=\"wp-image-1043\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-spacing-tokens.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-spacing-tokens-300x124.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-spacing-tokens-768x316.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Create simple t-shirt sized spacing options based on increments of 8 points. Why 8? Many popular screen sizes are divisible by 8 and it provides a bit more spacing flexibility than using 10 points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also known as using an 8 point grid, as all interface elements will end up aligning to a series of vertical and horizontal guidelines separated by 8 points. For more detailed interfaces, you could use 4 point increments for a bit more control.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like a typography scale, your spacing options should grow by larger amounts as they get bigger. This ensures that spacing is proportional for larger interface elements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Predefine other style options<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to create sets of predefined options for any other styles you use too. You\u2019ll generally need 2 shadow options (raised and overlay) to indicate the depth of interface elements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-shadows.webp\" alt=\"Design system shadows\" class=\"wp-image-1044\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-shadows.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-shadows-300x119.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-shadows-768x304.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Create 3 border radius options (8pt, 16pt, and 32pt) to use on small, medium, and large interface elements respectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"538\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-border-radius-1.webp\" alt=\"Design system border radius\" class=\"wp-image-1050\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-border-radius-1.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-border-radius-1-300x119.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-border-radius-1-768x304.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Create reusable modules<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another key part of building a design system is creating reusable parts or modules. Modular design involves breaking things down into smaller, reusable, and replaceable parts called modules or components. Modular design has been used to create cars, machines, buildings, and computers for many years. It\u2019s a great way to improve productivity, efficiency and consistency.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always aim to design interfaces in a modular way by doing the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Start by creating the smallest components such as <a href=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/blog\/ui-design\/button-design-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">buttons<\/a>, avatars, and form input fields. These will be your building blocks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Combine small components to create larger, more complex ones.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Arrange components in specific layouts to create reusable page templates.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"734\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-components-and-templates.webp\" alt=\"Components being combined into templates\" class=\"wp-image-1047\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-components-and-templates.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-components-and-templates-300x162.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-components-and-templates-768x414.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is to create a collection of all components, known as a component library or UI kit. This makes it easy to view, manage, and reuse components.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following example, an avatar component is used to create larger components. Firstly, the avatar is paired with text, then placed in a card, which is placed in a list of cards on a landing page template.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1834\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-components.webp\" alt=\"Design system components\" class=\"wp-image-1053\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-components.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-components-222x300.webp 222w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-components-768x1036.webp 768w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-components-1139x1536.webp 1139w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following examples, the same button component is reused inside multiple larger components. In a similar way, each of the larger components can be reused across multiple interfaces or templates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1366\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-button-component.webp\" alt=\"Button component being used in different larger components\" class=\"wp-image-1054\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-button-component.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-button-component-300x300.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-button-component-150x150.webp 150w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-button-component-768x771.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Define usage guidelines<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you build a design system, don&#8217;t forget to include instructions on how to use the components and visual styles in the design system. Without clear usage guidelines, there\u2019s little chance that a team of designers and developers will be able to design a consistent product experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep guidance concise so that it\u2019s easy to consume and remember. Concise guidelines keep things flexible enough to allow for creative freedom while also maintaining an acceptable level of consistency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create specific usage guidelines for the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Colours<\/strong> &#8211; define how and where colours should be used e.g. indicate interactive elements using the brand colour.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Text<\/strong> &#8211; define overarching guidelines for using text e.g. use sentence case, left align text.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Components<\/strong> &#8211; define best practices for each component including dos and don\u2019ts e.g. for the button component, ensure buttons are left aligned and avoid disabled buttons.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Templates<\/strong> &#8211; define how components should be used in different templates and any limitations.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Copywriting<\/strong> &#8211; define guidelines for grammar, punctuation, and writing style e.g. front-load text, be concise, and use plain and simple language.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Include any specific rules, do\u2019s and don&#8217;ts, live examples, and code snippets. It\u2019s also helpful to include a change log to record updates as well as a future roadmap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design, code, or both?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A design system can exist in a design tool like Figma, where it helps to speed up a design team\u2019s workflow. It can also exist in code, where it helps to speed up development. Ideally, a design system will help both designers and developers build websites and apps faster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a common approach to build a design system is to create a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.practical-ui.com\/design-system\/\">Figma design system<\/a> as a <a href=\"https:\/\/help.figma.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360041051154-Guide-to-libraries-in-Figma\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">library<\/a> for designers to work from along with a coded version of the design system built in <a href=\"https:\/\/react.dev\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">React<\/a> and documented in <a href=\"https:\/\/storybook.js.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Storybook<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"746\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-storybook-1.webp\" alt=\"Storybook screenshot\" class=\"wp-image-1060\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-storybook-1.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-storybook-1-300x165.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-storybook-1-768x421.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your skillset and resources, you can start off with design or code and gradually build the design system as you go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design systems for existing websites and apps<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you have an existing website or app but don\u2019t yet have a design system? The basic process is the same, but you\u2019ll need to do an initial audit to see what you\u2019ve got, what you need, and what you can get rid of.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Initial audit<\/strong> &#8211; identify and document all components and styles present in your website or app. Simply taking screenshots is a quick and easy approach.<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Group items into categories<\/strong> &#8211; group similar items together into categories including: text styles, colours, icons, buttons, navigation, headers, footers, cards, lists, and forms.<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Merge similar items<\/strong> &#8211; try to cut down the number of different components and styles in your system. For example, if you have 2 different button styles that are very similar, consider using 1 of them and removing the other. Map unneeded styles or components to new ones.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be a large and difficult process to move an existing website or app to a new design system. I find it best to take an iterative approach, where you do it bit by bit. Start with the most impactful items like colours and typography, then move onto components one at a time. The following example of a <a href=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/portfolio\/creating-a-lean-design-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">button audit<\/a> demonstrates how having too many similar options can greatly increase complexity. If you&#8217;re currently working on buttons, here are some <a href=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/blog\/ui-design\/button-design-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">common button mistakes<\/a> you should avoid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"598\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-button-audit.webp\" alt=\"Button audit\" class=\"wp-image-1058\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-button-audit.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-button-audit-300x132.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-button-audit-768x338.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re updating a page or feature that touches certain components, update those components as part of the feature release. Incorporating the cleanup into your general business will take more time initially, but it will save a lot more time in the long run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you know it, you\u2019ll be well on your way to replacing your old website or app with newly built design system components. During the interim period, both the old and new website or app will exist, before the old one is eventually decommissioned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design system team structure<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The many advantages of a design system are only realised if it\u2019s used and contributed to by everyone working on the website or app. If you\u2019re a solo creator, it\u2019s easy to ensure a design system is used and updated regularly. If you\u2019re part of a team in a larger organisation, it can be more complicated.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An approach that generally works well is to have a dedicated centralised design system team. This team serves other product teams by maintaining and managing the design system on a day to day basis. A centralised design system team doesn\u2019t work well unless there\u2019s collaboration with the product teams that are building product features for customers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each product team should have at least one design system ambassador that\u2019s responsible for collaborating with the centralised design system team. Their job is to ensure their team is aligned to the design system guidelines and to contribute customer feedback, insights, and even new components to the design system team. This collaborative approach helps to ensure the design system better services both the team\u2019s and customer\u2019s needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"900\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-team-structure.webp\" alt=\"Design system centralised team structure\" class=\"wp-image-1063\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-team-structure.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-team-structure-300x199.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/design-system-team-structure-768x508.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t have the budget for a dedicated centralised team, the ambassadors from each product team could form a team to build and manage the design system on a part time basis.
