Although it&#8217;s a super powerful tool on its own, it can be made even more powerful with plugins that can extend its functionality. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll explore some of the best Figma plugins for web design. I&#8217;ve found them super helpful in my design workflow. They can transform the way you approach web design, helping you create stunning, user-friendly websites with ease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are Figma plugins?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Figma plugins are powerful tools that extend the functionality of Figma. They&#8217;re created and maintained by third parties, basically other designers and developers. These plugins enable you to enhance your workflow by automating repetitive tasks, integrating with other tools, and adding new features that are not available in the core application. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Top Figma plugins for web design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re looking to speed up repetitive tasks, add unique visual elements, or improve collaboration, Figma&#8217;s plugin ecosystem has something for everyone. It&#8217;s crazy how many plugins are available out there. If you can think of it, there&#8217;s probably a plugin that can do it. Let&#8217;s get into my top Figma plugins for web design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contrast<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Quickly check WCAG colour contrast to ensure your web designs are accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"764\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/wcag-contrast-figma-plugin.webp\" alt=\"Contrast Figma plugin for web design\" class=\"wp-image-1081\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/wcag-contrast-figma-plugin.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/wcag-contrast-figma-plugin-300x169.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/wcag-contrast-figma-plugin-768x431.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrast is one of the best Figma plugins for web designers focused on accessibility. It seamlessly integrates into your Figma workflow, allowing you to quickly check the contrast ratios of colours against the background according to WCAG standards. This immediate feedback facilitates on-the-fly adjustments, ensuring designs remain accessible throughout the design process. Additionally, Contrast can scan entire pages to identify text-based contrast issues, saving time and ensuring no element is overlooked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin&#8217;s versatility is another strong point, as it works on various elements, including text, gradients, image backgrounds, transparent fills, and more. The Smart Sampling feature accurately analyzes complex backgrounds, while the plugin&#8217;s speed and responsiveness make it feasible to keep open while working.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great thing that sets this contrast checker apart from the others is that it supports the Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA). This new and improved way to measure contrast is part of the WCAG 3 draft and it helps solve some of the limitations of the WCAG 2 method.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.figma.com\/community\/plugin\/748533339900865323\/contrast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Contrast Figma plugin<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Photopea<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Edit photos, apply effects, filters, add text, crop or resize pictures inside Figma for free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"764\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/photo-editor-figma-plugin.webp\" alt=\"Photopea Figma plugin\" class=\"wp-image-1082\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/photo-editor-figma-plugin.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/photo-editor-figma-plugin-300x169.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/photo-editor-figma-plugin-768x431.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s crazy that the Photopea advanced photo editor plugin for Figma is free.
