It wasn\u2019t until recently that I realised I\u2019d been making some common button design mistakes (and I\u2019m not the only one).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you pull out your phone, open a few apps and browse a some websites, I\u2019ll bet you come across quite a few buttons. I\u2019ll also bet that many of those buttons have issues that pose a potential risk to usability and accessibility. There are a lot of problematic buttons out there, even from large companies and experienced designers, so I put together some quick and practical button design tips to avoid these problems and design better buttons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, I\u2019ll go through some popular button designs and highlight their problems using objective UI design principles. I\u2019ll avoid any subjective thoughts based on aesthetics, \u201cgut feeling\u201d, or what looks pretty. I also won\u2019t go into code here, as there\u2019s a lot we can do on the design side of things first. I\u2019ll finish up with some button design tips and suggestions for best practice button design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The purpose of buttons in UI design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In UI design, buttons serve as interactive elements that allow users to perform actions or make choices within a website or application. They are fundamental components that guide user interactions and help achieve various tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most projects, your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.practical-ui.com\/design-system\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">design system<\/a> will need 3 button weights to indicate the relative importance of actions: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Primary buttons<\/strong> are the most prominent button used to highlight the most important action.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Secondary buttons<\/strong> are usually the alternative to the primary action. Use secondary buttons for less important actions or for multiple actions that have equal importance.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tertiary buttons<\/strong> are especially good for displaying multiple actions or destructive actions that you want to make less prominent. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we\u2019ll compare groups of these 3 button weights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common button&nbsp;design mistakes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve highlighted the issues with some popular button designs below. These issues pose a potential risk to usability, so it\u2019s safest to avoid them if possible. We\u2019re aiming to at least meet <a href=\"https:\/\/www.w3.org\/WAI\/standards-guidelines\/wcag\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WCAG 2.0 level AA accessibility requirements<\/a> as this is the most common standard and a good place to start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Button group&nbsp;1<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"232\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/ui-design-button-style-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Buttons styles in which primary button has a high contrast fill, secondary button has a low contrast fill, and tertiary button is underlined text.\" class=\"wp-image-1006\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/ui-design-button-style-1-1.jpg 1360w, https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/ui-design-button-style-1-1-300x51.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/ui-design-button-style-1-1-768x131.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>User interface components like form fields, buttons, and tabs, need to have a colour contrast ratio of at least 3:1. Contrast is a measure of the difference in perceived brightness between two colours. It\u2019s expressed as a ratio ranging from 1:1 to 21:1. High contrast helps people with vision impairment tell the difference between different interface components. Decorative styles that aren\u2019t required to distinguish interface components don&#8217;t need high contrast. There are lots of tools and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/blog\/web-design\/10-best-figma-plugins-for-web-design-in-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Figma plugins<\/a> to help you measure colour contrast, my favourites are the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/webaim.org\/resources\/contrastchecker\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Web AIM online contrast check tool<\/a> and the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.figma.com\/community\/plugin\/748533339900865323\/contrast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Contrast Figma plugin<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this example, the secondary button fill contrast ratio against the background is less than 3:1, which is too low to clearly indicate the button shape to the vision impaired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some may argue that the secondary button fill is decorative and doesn\u2019t need to have a contrast ratio of 3:1 to be accessible. The fill is needed to identify the secondary button as a button. Without the fill, it\u2019s just plain blue text with no indicator of interactivity but colour. You could add a high contrast border to the secondary button to fix this issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Button group&nbsp;2<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"232\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/ui-design-button-style-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"Buttons styles in which primary button has a high contrast fill, secondary button has a grey outline with no fill, and tertiary button is underlined text.\" class=\"wp-image-1007\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/ui-design-button-style-2-1.jpg 1360w, https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/ui-design-button-style-2-1-300x51.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/ui-design-button-style-2-1-768x131.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The button styles in group 2 have the following issues:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The secondary button could be mistaken as being unavailable or in a disabled state due to its light grey colour.

This means that those who are colour blind may not be able to distinguish it from plain text.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The context, position and close proximity of the tertiary button to other buttons may help distinguish it from plain text in some cases, but there\u2019s still a risk that it may cause confusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Button group&nbsp;8<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"232\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/ui-design-button-style-8-1.jpg\" alt=\"Buttons styles in which primary button has a round shape that\u2019s different to the rectangular shape of other buttons.\" class=\"wp-image-1013\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/ui-design-button-style-8-1.jpg 1360w, https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/ui-design-button-style-8-1-300x51.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/ui-design-button-style-8-1-768x131.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Every detail of an interface design should have a logical purpose.

The button styles in this example have the following issues:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The visual hierarchy is unclear as the primary and secondary buttons have similar visual weight or prominence.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The secondary button background contrast ratio is below 3:1, which is too low to clearly indicate the button shape to the vision impaired.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Button design&nbsp;tips<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the previous button design mistakes, here are some quick and practical tips to keep in mind to design user-friendly and accessible buttons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Buttons should have a clear visual hierarchy that doesn\u2019t depend on colour alone.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The contrast ratio of the button shape must be at least 3:1 to ensure people who are vision impaired can identify it as an interactive element.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Button text contrast ratio must be at least 4.5:1 to meet WCAG 2.1 level AA accessibility requirements.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If buttons have identical styles, the contrast ratio between them must be at least 3:1 to ensure they\u2019re distinguishable to the vision impaired.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use a large target area (at least 48pt by 48pt) to ensure people can easily select buttons.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make sure there\u2019s sufficient space between buttons so people don\u2019t mistakenly select the wrong one. I usually use 16pt to be safe.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These button design tips are from my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.practical-ui.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">UI design book<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A safe option for better&nbsp;buttons<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following button styles are familiar, accessible, and have a clear visual hierarchy that isn\u2019t dependent on colour alone.

Traditionally text links were designed to <em>go somewhere<\/em> and buttons were designed to <em>perform an action. <\/em>These days, many are unaware of this interaction pattern and certainly wouldn\u2019t expect it, so I don\u2019t think we need to stick to it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following hero banner example, links are used to take people to another page. The problem is that links aren\u2019t prominent enough to indicate that they\u2019re the most important actions on the page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1536\" height=\"696\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/hero-banner-links-1.jpg\" alt=\"Hero banner example with 2 underlined text links highlighting the main calls to action.\" class=\"wp-image-1005\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/hero-banner-links-1.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/hero-banner-links-1-300x136.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.sitegrazzarte.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/hero-banner-links-1-768x348.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Changing the links to look like buttons helps make them more prominent and create a clearer visual hierarchy.
