I\u2019ve studied hundreds of design systems over the years, even before they were called design systems, and in this article I\u2019ll be highlighting what I\u2019ve learned from some of the best design system examples I\u2019ve come across so that you can <a href=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/blog\/design-systems\/how-to-build-a-design-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">build your own design system<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many similarities across design systems, but there are still lots of details that designers can\u2019t seem to agree on. It\u2019s fascinating to see the differences and the rationale behind the designs. Colour systems, component design, and indicating elevation are a few areas of inconsistency across design systems. Luckily, many popular design patterns are similar across design systems, which is great for users, as they won\u2019t need to relearn new patterns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s go over some design system basics before we start exploring the design system examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a design system?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"841\" height=\"562\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/lego-blocks-design-system.png\" alt=\"Different types of lego blocks to represent a design system\" class=\"wp-image-1260\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/lego-blocks-design-system.png 841w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/lego-blocks-design-system-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/lego-blocks-design-system-768x513.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 841px) 100vw, 841px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.practical-ui.com\/design-system\/\">design system<\/a> is like a box of LEGO bricks for digital products. Just as LEGO bricks come in different shapes, sizes, and colours that you can snap together to build anything you can imagine, a design system provides a set of pre-made components, like <a href=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/blog\/ui-design\/button-design-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">buttons<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/blog\/icons\/free-icon-sets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">icons<\/a>, and form inputs, that you can combine to create consistent and cohesive user interfaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like with LEGO, where you have instructions to guide you in building a specific model, a design system comes with guidelines that show you how to use the components. This ensures that the website or application you\u2019re building looks and works consistently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A design system serves as a single source of truth that ensures that all design and development teams are aligned, enabling them to build unified products more efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of a design system<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having endless design possibilities sounds great in theory, but in practice, it can be frustrating and time consuming. When designing an interface, there are so many options to choose from regarding layout, spacing, typography, and colour, it can quickly get overwhelming. That\u2019s why having a system of predefined options and guidelines to help you efficiently make design decisions is crucial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re working on a small website or a complex web application, a design system is a must-have for many reasons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Consistency<\/strong>: Ensures a uniform look and feel across all products, enhancing the user experience.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Efficiency<\/strong>: Speeds up the design and development process by providing ready-to-use components and design guidelines.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Scalability<\/strong>: Makes it easier to scale products by providing a foundation that can grow with the brand or product.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Collaboration<\/strong>: Enhances collaboration between design and development teams by providing a common language and set of tools.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Quality control<\/strong>: Helps maintain high-quality standards across all designs, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Practical UI Figma design system<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"972\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/mimo-da-dany-practical-ui.webp\" alt=\"Figma design system\" class=\"wp-image-1061\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/mimo-da-dany-practical-ui.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/mimo-da-dany-practical-ui-300x214.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/mimo-da-dany-practical-ui-768x549.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I love design systems so much that I actually created my own. I wanted to share what I\u2019ve learned by creating a lean and powerful Figma design system that&#8217;s intuitive, accessible, and beautiful. Creating this design system has truly been a labour of love and I&#8217;ve spent thousands of hours crafting every detail. It&#8217;s based on logic-driven design guidelines from my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.practical-ui.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">UI design book<\/a>, which has helped thousands improve their interface design skills.

It\u2019s cleverly designed, practical to use, and has a wealth of detailed and sensible guidance. It\u2019s open-source and has a modular framework designed to create consistent, scalable, and accessible digital experiences across IBM&#8217;s diverse product suite.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I learned<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than using shadows to indicate depth or elevation, the Carbon design system uses colour. As expected in dark mode, colours get progressively lighter as the elevation level increases. Light mode is a bit different to most design systems though. Colours simply alternate between white and grey with each level of elevation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1152\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/color-layering-model.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1264\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/color-layering-model.png 1152w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/color-layering-model-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/color-layering-model-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This unconventional system generally works well for most applications, as they only require a few levels of elevation. Here\u2019s an example dashboard design in light and dark mode.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"994\" height=\"606\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/color-overview-themes-gray10-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1267\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/color-overview-themes-gray10-1.png 994w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/color-overview-themes-gray10-1-300x183.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/color-overview-themes-gray10-1-768x468.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"991\" height=\"605\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/color-overview-themes-gray90-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1268\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/color-overview-themes-gray90-1.png 991w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/color-overview-themes-gray90-1-300x183.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/color-overview-themes-gray90-1-768x469.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 991px) 100vw, 991px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most design systems only provide usage guidelines for each component, whereas the Carbon design system also covers larger UI patterns such as logins, forms, and filtering. For example, there are many different ways to filter data depending on the context. Carbon design system helps designers and developers decide on a suitable pattern based on their specific situation. The following filtering pattern uses a multi-select dropdown menu.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full border is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1152\" height=\"567\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/design-system-filter.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1269\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/design-system-filter.png 1152w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/design-system-filter-300x148.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/design-system-filter-768x378.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The next example is of a filtering pattern that\u2019s always on display in the sidenav, for faster and more complex filtering of data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full border is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1152\" height=\"878\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/design-system-filter-side.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1270\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/design-system-filter-side.png 1152w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/design-system-filter-side-300x229.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/design-system-filter-side-768x585.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Documenting design patterns in this way makes it a lot easier for designers and developers to follow and helps to ensure consistency across applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The component guidance and colour system is also clever and comprehensive. There\u2019s so much to learn from this design system, even as an experienced designer. That\u2019s what makes it my top design system example.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/carbondesignsystem.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">View IBM\u2019s Carbon Design System<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Atlassian Design System<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full border is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1310\" height=\"831\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/atlassian-design-system.png\" alt=\"Atlassian Design System\" class=\"wp-image-1274\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/atlassian-design-system.png 1310w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/atlassian-design-system-300x190.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/atlassian-design-system-768x487.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1310px) 100vw, 1310px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking through the Atlassian Design System, you can very quickly see the meticulous thought and attention to detail that has been put into it. It can initially be a bit overwhelming to digest due to its size and complexity, but when you consider that it\u2019s supporting a whole suite of products, it\u2019s actually relatively concise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I learned<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Atlassian has treated elevation in a more conventional way that makes a lot of sense. I actually used a similar approach in my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.practical-ui.com\/design-system\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Practical UI Figma design system<\/a>. In light mode they use shadows to indicate depth, while in dark mode they use both shadows and colour.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have 4 design tokens to indicate elevation, which should be sufficient for most website applications. One of the elevation tokens sits lower than the default surface level for sunken interface elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"889\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/darkElevationsExample.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1275\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/darkElevationsExample.png 1920w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/darkElevationsExample-300x139.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/darkElevationsExample-768x356.png 768w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/darkElevationsExample-1536x711.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Each elevation colour token has a corresponding shadow token for consistency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"661\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/darkShadowExample.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1276\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/darkShadowExample.png 1920w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/darkShadowExample-300x103.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/darkShadowExample-768x264.png 768w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/darkShadowExample-1536x529.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The colour system is also really well designed. I especially like that they use alpha, or transparent, colours alongside more conventional solid colours. Using transparent colours for foreground elements helps to ensure that they look consistent when sitting on different background colours. I\u2019ve also used transparent colours in my own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.practical-ui.com\/design-system\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Figma design system<\/a> and I think transparency will become more prevalent once more design teams realise the advantages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"714\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/alpha-neutrals_3x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1277\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/alpha-neutrals_3x.png 1920w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/alpha-neutrals_3x-300x112.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/alpha-neutrals_3x-768x286.png 768w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/alpha-neutrals_3x-1536x571.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The design token naming conventions are also quite intuitive. Design tokens are the basic building blocks used to store and apply design decisions consistently across a digital product. In simple terms, they\u2019re like little pieces of information that define things like colours, fonts, spacing, and sizes, so that these elements can be used the same way in different places, keeping the design consistent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2000\" height=\"887\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/ads-libraries_-_light-2000x887.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1278\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/ads-libraries_-_light-2000x887.png 2000w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/ads-libraries_-_light-300x133.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/ads-libraries_-_light-768x341.png 768w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/ads-libraries_-_light-1536x681.png 1536w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/ads-libraries_-_light-2048x908.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for ideas on how to best name design tokens, it\u2019s worth checking out how Atlassian has done it. They even have a <a href=\"https:\/\/atlassian.design\/components\/tokens\/all-tokens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">token picker tool<\/a> to help you find and apply the correct colour token.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded border\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"996\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/tokens_in_screen.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1279\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/tokens_in_screen.png 1920w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/tokens_in_screen-300x156.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/tokens_in_screen-768x398.png 768w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/tokens_in_screen-1536x797.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Those were just a few of my favourite parts of this beautifully designed design system.

Its comprehensive guidance and clear examples almost make it a crash course in UI design. It covers all the basics like colour, typography, and components, but also includes often forgotten details like motion design, copywriting, and inclusive design.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I learned<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While most design systems use the same sized components across both mobile and desktop, Adobe has chosen to <a href=\"https:\/\/spectrum.adobe.com\/page\/platform-scale\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">scale up<\/a> the size of components and typography on mobile devices.

I&#8217;ve provided a brief summary for each design system and highlighted what&#8217;s unique about it. Let&#8217;s get into these other design system examples. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Google\u2019s Material Design System<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2000\" height=\"785\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-material-design-system-2000x785.png\" alt=\"Google\u2019s Material Design System\" class=\"wp-image-1286\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-material-design-system-2000x785.png 2000w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-material-design-system-300x118.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-material-design-system-768x302.png 768w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-material-design-system-1536x603.png 1536w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/google-material-design-system.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Google\u2019s Material Design is well-known for its unique &#8220;material metaphor,&#8221; which mimics physical surfaces to create a natural sense of interaction. Its open-source nature and adaptive design principles, like motion and depth, make it a go-to system for building intuitive and responsive user experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main downside to this design system is its complexity. Then again, its complexity is what makes it so flexible and adaptable to different app designs. You could easily spend a week learning about it and still only have scratched the surface. I guess that\u2019s why some designers have a specific focus on designing Android apps, as it\u2019s taken them considerable time to learn the ins and outs of Material Design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The colour and theming system is especially clever and versatile, so I\u2019d suggest checking it out if you\u2019re looking to introduce themes to your design system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/m3.material.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">View Google\u2019s Material Design System<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Shopify\u2019s Polaris Design System<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1344\" height=\"756\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/shopify-polaris-design-system.png\" alt=\"Shopify\u2019s Polaris Design System\" class=\"wp-image-1287\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/shopify-polaris-design-system.png 1344w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/shopify-polaris-design-system-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/shopify-polaris-design-system-768x432.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1344px) 100vw, 1344px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Shopify\u2019s Polaris Design System is one of few design systems focused on e-commerce with tools that streamline product pages, checkout flows, and customer management. If you\u2019re designing an e-commerce website, there\u2019s definitely lots to learn from Polaris.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the great things about Polaris is the wealth of visual examples in their guidance material. Rather than simply telling you how to use components or apply colours, it shows you with detailed examples. This makes it much faster and easier to learn.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polaris\u2019s visual design aesthetics are also top notch, making it a great place to learn not just how to build a functional website but also a beautiful one.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/polaris.shopify.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">View Shopify\u2019s Polaris Design System<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Github\u2019s Primer Design System<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"608\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/github-primer-design-system.png\" alt=\"Github\u2019s Primer Design System\" class=\"wp-image-1288\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/github-primer-design-system.png 1920w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/github-primer-design-system-300x95.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/github-primer-design-system-768x243.png 768w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/github-primer-design-system-1536x486.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Primer is Github\u2019s developer-first design system that excels in providing a strong foundation for consistency and functionality across code-centric platforms. Its unique focus on open-source collaboration and its extensive CSS framework make it highly customizable and developer-friendly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Design systems often cater their guidance documentation towards designers, but it\u2019s important to remember that developers also require guidance on how to use the system. It\u2019s great to see that Github provides comprehensive developer documentation. If you\u2019re looking for ideas to beef up your usage guidelines for developers using your design system, Primer is definitely worth a look.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/primer.style\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">View Github\u2019s Primer Design System<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Apple\u2019s Human Interface Guidelines<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1480\" height=\"832\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/apple-human-interface-guidelines.png\" alt=\"Apple\u2019s Human Interface Guidelines\" class=\"wp-image-1289\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/apple-human-interface-guidelines.png 1480w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/apple-human-interface-guidelines-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/apple-human-interface-guidelines-768x432.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1480px) 100vw, 1480px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is probably the most famous of our design system examples, although I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s one of the best. Apple\u2019s Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) emphasize intuitive user experiences, refined through years of crafting world-class products. What makes HIG unique is its integration with Apple\u2019s hardware and software ecosystems, allowing for deeply immersive and seamless experiences on devices like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, Apple\u2019s Human Interface Guidelines aren\u2019t very easy to consume, as they\u2019re very text heavy with limited visual examples. They\u2019re also not very detailed, which can leave you wondering if you\u2019re using the design system correctly or not. This is probably one of the reasons why some designers focus specifically on designing for iOS, as there\u2019s quite a high learning curve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">View Apple\u2019s Human Interface Guidelines<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gov.uk Design System<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"813\" height=\"733\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/gov-uk-design-system.png\" alt=\"Gov.uk Design System\" class=\"wp-image-1290\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/gov-uk-design-system.png 813w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/gov-uk-design-system-300x270.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/gov-uk-design-system-768x692.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 813px) 100vw, 813px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While it\u2019s not the most beautiful design language, the Gov.uk Design System stands out for its strict emphasis on accessibility and inclusion, designed specifically for public services. With a commitment to ensuring that everyone can access government information and services, it offers high standards for usability, focusing on clarity, simplicity, and accessibility for all citizens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main strengths of this design system is the fact that most of its components and design patterns have been validated by user testing and research. They\u2019ve also been tested to ensure they\u2019re accessible. So if you\u2019re doing component research, the Gov.uk design system is a handy resource.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it\u2019s focused on usability and accessibility, you\u2019ll also find that the system is relatively simple and easy to follow. If a design system servicing so many people can be this simple, it makes you wonder why other design systems are so complex. Sure, it may lack the flexibility of some design systems, but simplicity is generally a good thing for both the people using the website and the product teams building it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/design-system.service.gov.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">View Gov.uk Design System<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Microsoft\u2019s Fluent 2 Design System<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded border\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1536\" height=\"740\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/microsoft-fluent-design-system.webp\" alt=\"Microsoft\u2019s Fluent 2 Design System\" class=\"wp-image-1291\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/microsoft-fluent-design-system.webp 1536w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/microsoft-fluent-design-system-300x145.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/microsoft-fluent-design-system-768x370.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft has come a long way with their design language and are now pushing the boundaries with their modern and colourful aesthetic. Their comprehensive design system covers web, iOS, Android, and Windows platforms. Guidance for each platform is separated to keep things organised, while the foundational design guidelines are consistent across platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While their guidance isn\u2019t super detailed, it\u2019s enough to get by and makes it quick and easy to learn. Microsoft\u2019s Fluent 2 Design System doesn\u2019t excel in any particular area, but it\u2019s a solid design system as a whole. This makes it a great example of all the main elements a good design system needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fluent2.microsoft.design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">View Microsoft\u2019s Fluent 2 Design System<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gitlab Pajamas Design System<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"712\" height=\"790\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/gitlab-design-system.png\" alt=\"Gitlab Pajamas Design System\" class=\"wp-image-1292\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/gitlab-design-system.png 712w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/gitlab-design-system-270x300.png 270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things missing from most design systems is community collaboration.

It\u2019s well organised and very comprehensive.

Motion design can make a big difference in product design and it\u2019s often put in the \u201ctoo hard\u201d basket for later. Having clear guidance on motion design principles and patterns helps to ensure that it\u2019s implemented frequently and consistently.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lightningdesignsystem.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">View Salesforce\u2019s Lightning Design System<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vercel\u2019s Geist Design System<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded border\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1051\" height=\"772\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/vercel-design-system.png\" alt=\"Vercel\u2019s Geist Design System\" class=\"wp-image-1295\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/vercel-design-system.png 1051w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/vercel-design-system-300x220.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/vercel-design-system-768x564.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1051px) 100vw, 1051px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Vercel\u2019s Geist Design System is known for its minimalist aesthetic and performance-driven design, catering to web developers who prioritize speed and simplicity.

You can learn some solid fundamental design principles from this design system example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/gel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">View BBC\u2019s GEL Design System<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mozilla\u2019s Protocol Design System<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1328\" height=\"754\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/mozilla-protocol-design-system.png\" alt=\"Mozilla\u2019s Protocol Design System\" class=\"wp-image-1297\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/mozilla-protocol-design-system.png 1328w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/mozilla-protocol-design-system-300x170.png 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/mozilla-protocol-design-system-768x436.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1328px) 100vw, 1328px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mozilla\u2019s Protocol Design System is an open-source framework optimized for the web, supporting Mozilla\u2019s mission of keeping the internet open and accessible. Its focus on privacy-first design and support for Mozilla\u2019s products like Firefox and MDN Web Docs makes it uniquely aligned with open-source web principles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their usage guidelines are very concise and components are limited, so it\u2019s a quick design system to learn. It goes to show that a lean design system can go a long way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/protocol.mozilla.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">View Mozilla\u2019s Protocol Design System<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you&#8217;ve found these design system examples helpful and inspiring. Each of them is basically a free UI design course that also teaches you how to scale designs across multiple products and platforms.
