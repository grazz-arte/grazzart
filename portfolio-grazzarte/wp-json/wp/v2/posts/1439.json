One of the best ways to push through this barrier is to look at other websites for inspiration. I\u2019ve been designing websites for decades and over the years I\u2019ve collected my go-to free web design inspiration sites.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many free web design inspiration sites out there, it\u2019s difficult to know which ones to use, so I\u2019ve compared the top sites based on how often they\u2019re updated, their search filter functionality, website previews, newsletters, and social media channels. I\u2019ve also pulled out my top 3 free web design inspiration sites to make it even easier. I hope you find them helpful and inspiring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3 best free web design inspiration sites<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many awesome free web design inspiration sites, it was hard to narrow it down to just 3.

Their site features a curated collection of visually stunning and technically impressive websites, rated by experts on design, usability, creativity, and content.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awwwards is a bit different to most web design inspiration sites, as designers need to submit their website for consideration by the expert judging panel. Each day, the judging panel will vote for the highly coveted \u201csite of the day\u201d, which is featured on the website homepage. I was lucky enough to win site of the day for my <a href=\"https:\/\/www.awwwards.com\/sites\/site-grazzarte-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">portfolio website<\/a> back in 2010.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many website submissions from top designers around the world and such a rigorous voting process, the result is a highly curated collection of daily web design inspiration from top designers around the world. You can filter websites by category, technology, country, fonts, and colour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Awwwards also has a vibrant community where designers can participate in discussions, vote on submissions, and learn from detailed case studies. Additionally, they host educational courses, interviews with industry leaders, and events to help you stay on top of your web design game. Basically your one-stop shop for web design inspiration.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unique features include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Expert-rated designs<\/strong>: Websites featured on Awwwards are evaluated by a panel of experts based on design, usability, creativity, and content, offering high-quality, curated inspiration.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Community engagement<\/strong>: Designers can actively participate by voting, commenting, and contributing to discussions, making Awwwards a great place to learn from other designers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Collections: <\/strong>Websites have been organised into helpful categories to help you quickly gain inspiration on specific areas of web design such as: about us pages, 404 pages, footers, animation, and navigation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Case studies and insights<\/strong>: Detailed case studies and in-depth interviews with top designers provide valuable insights into the creative process and emerging trends.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Educational content<\/strong>: The site offers workshops, courses, and articles to help designers hone their skills and stay updated on the latest design techniques.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Events and conferences<\/strong>: Awwwards organises global conferences and events, bringing together design leaders and providing networking opportunities for professionals.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Daily inspiration<\/strong>: A regularly updated feed of award-winning websites provides a steady stream of fresh and innovative web design ideas.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.awwwards.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Visit Awwwards<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The FWA<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded border\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/fwa-web-design-inspiration.webp\" alt=\"The FWA web design inspiration\" class=\"wp-image-1446\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/fwa-web-design-inspiration.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/fwa-web-design-inspiration-300x176.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/fwa-web-design-inspiration-768x452.webp 768w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/fwa-web-design-inspiration-680x400.webp 680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table class=\"summary-list\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Updated:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Daily<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Community submissions:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Curation:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Judging panel with scoring system<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Filters:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Search<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Website preview:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Desktop image slideshow<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Newsletter:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Monthly<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Social media channels:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">X, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The FWA (Favourite Website Awards) was founded back in 2000 and is still one of the top platforms for free web design inspiration. It started off showcasing cutting-edge Flash websites that were famous for rich animations and immersive interactions. Now it\u2019s a bit more well rounded and features daily website award winners that push the boundaries of design and user experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Awwwards, The FWA also relies on an expert judging panel to rate each website submission. Nearly 300 judges can cast their vote over a 1 week period. To win the site of the day award, a website must have a minimum score of 70% and at least 20 judges must have voted. This helps ensure that you see only the highest quality web design inspiration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there aren\u2019t many filtering options to narrow down your search, but The FWA is still a great way to get your daily dose of web design inspiration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unique features include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Focus on innovation<\/strong>: The FWA highlights projects that utilise the latest technologies, such as WebGL, AR, and VR, setting it apart from sites that only showcase traditional web design.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Daily awards<\/strong>: Every day, a new standout website is featured, keeping content fresh and inspiring for regular visitors.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Spotlight on immersive experiences<\/strong>: Emphasis on interactive and experiential designs provides unique examples that go beyond standard websites.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Industry recognition<\/strong>: Winning an FWA award is considered a prestigious accolade in the digital design community, adding a level of prestige to the showcased websites.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Educational value<\/strong>: The site often includes details on the technology and techniques used in award-winning projects, offering a learning opportunity for web professionals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/thefwa.com\/\">Visit The FWA<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Curated Design<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/curated-web-design-inspiration.webp\" alt=\"Curated web design inspiration\" class=\"wp-image-1443\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/curated-web-design-inspiration.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/curated-web-design-inspiration-300x176.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/curated-web-design-inspiration-768x452.webp 768w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/curated-web-design-inspiration-680x400.webp 680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table class=\"summary-list\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Updated:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Daily<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Community submissions:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Curation:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Craftwork team<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Filters:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Search, industry, style, illustration style<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Website preview:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Desktop video<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Newsletter:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Weekly<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Social media channels:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">X, Telegram, Instagram, Facebook<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Curated Design is a super fun place to be on the internet and one of my favourite sources of free web design inspiration. It curates and showcases some of the most visually appealing websites on the web. While there\u2019s no public website scoring or rating system, websites are curated by the tasteful team at Craftwork.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Websites are sorted into industry categories, making it easy for you to browse through various styles and find inspiration tailored to your project. There are also some handy filters that allow you to further narrow down your search based on a particular style including: dark, pastel, minimal, and neobrutalist. I also love the video previews of each website, as you don\u2019t even need to leave the site while browsing. You can also subscribe to the weekly email newsletter to get web design inspiration delivered straight to your inbox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unique features include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Carefully selected content<\/strong>: The site handpicks only the best designs, ensuring a consistently high standard of inspiration.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Easy browsing<\/strong>: Projects are organised efficiently, allowing designers to explore different styles and layouts with ease.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Video preview<\/strong>: Each website has a handy video preview, so you don\u2019t even need to leave the site while browsing.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Focus on quality over quantity<\/strong>: Unlike sites that present a large volume of content, Curated Design prioritises showcasing impactful and relevant designs.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Diverse design styles<\/strong>: The platform includes a variety of website designs, appealing to a broad range of tastes and preferences.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Inspiration for specific needs<\/strong>: Whether you\u2019re looking for minimalistic, bold, or innovative design ideas, Curated Design offers a wide range of options to spark creativity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.curated.design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Visit Curated Design<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Other great free web design inspiration sites<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The top 3 free web design inspiration sites might be sufficient for most, but if you\u2019re keen for more web design inspiration, I\u2019ve got you covered.

You can tell that the creator of the site is passionate about typography. Each website is tagged with the typefaces in use, which allows you to browse websites by typeface. Similar typefaces are suggested to help you find new typefaces and improve your typography game.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that each website has a full page preview in both desktop and mobile sizes, so you can browse through websites without ever needing to leave the site.

This makes it much easier to hone in on a certain type of website inspiration.

The background even changes depending on the website you select, converting the website image thumbnail into a gradient background for a more harmonious vibe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there\u2019s no search functionality, the filters are handy enough to provide a powerful browsing experience. You can filter by style including brutalist, dark, illustrative, and minimal websites. You can also filter by industry type to narrow down your focus.

David\u2019s been adding his favourite websites since 2008 and now has an impressive collection of over 2,000 websites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each website is tagged by colour, style, CMS, and framework, which makes for a handy filter. I also like how each website has multiple full page screenshots, so you never have to leave the site when browsing. Anyone can vote on websites and rate them out of 10 based on design, creativity, and usability. I\u2019m not sure how the community ratings affect the website listings, as it looks like the site of the day is simply chosen by the curator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unique features include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Comprehensive tagging<\/strong>: Allows for easy filtering and browsing based on colour, style, CMS, and framework, making it simple to find specific inspiration.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>High-quality collection<\/strong>: The site features a curated selection of visually stunning websites from an experienced designer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Long-standing collection<\/strong>: It\u2019s cool to see how web design trends have changed over the years.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Comprehensive previews<\/strong>: Rather than simply showing a single small preview image of each website, Best Website Gallery includes multiple full page screenshots.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/bestwebsite.gallery\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Visit Best Website Gallery<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Unsection<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-style-rounded\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1360\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/unsection-web-design-inspiration.webp\" alt=\"Unsection web design inspiration\" class=\"wp-image-1451\" srcset=\"https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/unsection-web-design-inspiration.webp 1360w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/unsection-web-design-inspiration-300x176.webp 300w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/unsection-web-design-inspiration-768x452.webp 768w, https:\/\/portfolio-grazzarte\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/unsection-web-design-inspiration-680x400.webp 680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table class=\"summary-list\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Updated:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Weekly<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Community submissions:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Yes<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Curation:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Gita Ramdhani<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Filters:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Website section, style, type, industry<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Website preview:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Multiple desktop images<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Newsletter:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">Weekly<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"label\">Social media channels:<\/td>\n<td class=\"value\">X<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsection is different from most free web design inspiration sites.

Definitely my go-to spot for section-specific design inspiration including hero sections, headers, footers, and pricing sections.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from the main categories for different website sections, there are additional filters for website style, type, and industry. I also like that you can subscribe to their newsletter for weekly updates and follow them on X to see the latest featured websites.
